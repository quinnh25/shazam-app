    windowing across both frequency and time is used since low frequencies are amplified (equal-loudness contour), and different track sections (bridge, chorus, ..) have different average intensities;
    we don't want areas of the spectrogram with 'high activity' to have all of the peaks while neglecting areas with low but still important activity.
